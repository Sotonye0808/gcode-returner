# GCode API Migrations
"""
This directory contains Django database migrations for the gcode_api app.
Currently, no models are defined, so no migrations are needed.

If models are added in the future, migrations will be automatically
generated and stored in this directory.

To create migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations gcode_api
```

To apply migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
